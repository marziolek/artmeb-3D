### 3D visualiser for materials on furniture

Project start:
You need to have some php server running i.e. WAMP.
Open index.php. YAY! 

Now work :)

To do list:
- [ ] **Each obj need to be clickable/selectable.**
- [ ] **Set different material for each obj.**
- [ ] **Add switch toggle button: Every obj gets same material/Every obj gets different materials**
- [ ] Fix camera movement on mouse click, scroll etc.
- [ ] Adjust light.
- [ ] Add light switch or sth like this.

Bolded items are priority.
